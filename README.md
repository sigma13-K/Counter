# Counter App (React Native)

## App created based on the book "스무디 한 잔 마시며 끝내는 React Native"

- Made second react native application using react native CLI
- Learned about Props and State 
- Used Props and States with typescript defining exact data types
- Used useState in order to update "State" variable's value with "set" function 
- >(preventing problems while changing values, updating only changed part using "Virtual DOM" of React)



## Usage
- Description for ios app simulation
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/sigma13-K/Counter.git"
cd ./Counter/ios
pod install  # for first installation (ios simulator)
cd ../
npm run ios
```
